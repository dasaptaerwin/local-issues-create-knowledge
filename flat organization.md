An organization's structure refers to the nature of the distribution of the units and positions within it, also to the nature of the relationships among those units and positions.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization#cite_note-Edwin_E_1972-1) Tall and flat organizations differ based on how many levels of management are present in the organization and how much control managers are endowed with.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization#cite_note-Edwin_E_1972-1)
